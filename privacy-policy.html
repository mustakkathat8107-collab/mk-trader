It provides trading-related learning content for educational purposes.
MK Trader does not provide financial, investment, or legal advice.
No profit or income is guaranteed.
Users are fully responsible for how they use the information provided in the app.

<h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
We collect only the user's mobile number for login and authentication purposes.
We do not collect name, email address, contacts, SMS content, call logs, location data,
device media, or any personal files stored on the user's device.

<h3>3. Use of Data</h3>
The collected mobile number is used strictly for identity verification,
session management, security purposes, and access control for purchased content.
We do not sell, rent, or share user data with unauthorized third parties.

<h3>4. Payments</h3>
All payments made within the MK Trader app are processed only through Google Play Billing.
No external or third-party payment systems are used.
MK Trader does not store any card details, UPI information, or bank-related data.
Payment handling and security are fully managed by Google Play.

<h3>5. Refund Policy</h3>
All purchases made within the app are final.
Once a payment is successfully completed, it is strictly non-refundable
under any circumstances.
Any refund-related policies are governed by Google Play’s refund policy.

<h3>6. Account Access & Deletion</h3>
MK Trader provides users with full control over their account.
Users can delete their account directly from inside the app using the
available account delete option.
Once an account is deleted, all associated user data is permanently removed
and access to purchased content is revoked.
Account deletion is irreversible.

<h3>7. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
User data is retained only while the account is active.
When a user deletes their account, the associated data is deleted
from our systems within a reasonable time.
We do not retain unnecessary or inactive user data.

<h3>8. Data Security</h3>
User data is securely stored using Firebase and Google services.
Industry-standard security practices are implemented to protect user information.
However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure.

<h3>9. Third-Party Services</h3>
MK Trader may use trusted third-party services such as Google Firebase,
Google Analytics, and Google Play Services.
These services may collect limited information as per their respective
privacy policies.

<h3>10. Notifications</h3>
We may send notifications related to app updates, important information,
account activity, or purchase-related messages.
Users can disable notifications at any time from their device or app settings.

<h3>11. Children's Privacy</h3>
MK Trader is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
If such data is identified, it will be deleted immediately.

<h3>12. User Consent</h3>
By using the MK Trader application, users agree to this Privacy Policy
and consent to the collection and use of information as described.

<h3>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
MK Trader reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
Any changes will be reflected on this page.
Continued use of the app implies acceptance of the updated policy.

<h3>14. Legal Jurisdiction</h3>
This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance
with the laws of India.
    
<h3>15. Course Content Delivery & YouTube Integration</h3>
MK Trader may deliver certain course content through YouTube Unlisted Videos using secure in-app integration.
Unlisted videos are not publicly searchable on YouTube and are accessible only to authorized users who have enrolled in or purchased the relevant course.

<h3>16. YouTube Policy Compliance</h3>
The use of YouTube Unlisted Videos within the MK Trader application is fully compliant with
YouTube’s Terms of Service and applicable Developer Policies.
MK Trader does not download, store, modify, record, or redistribute any YouTube-hosted content.
All videos are streamed using official and permitted playback mechanisms only.

<h3>17. Advertisements on Third-Party Platforms</h3>
YouTube is a third-party platform and operates under its own advertising and content policies.
While YouTube Unlisted Videos generally do not display advertisements, in certain cases ads may appear
based on YouTube’s internal systems, user settings, region, or policy updates.

MK Trader does not control the display, frequency, or nature of such advertisements and is not responsible
for third-party advertising content.

<h3>18. Pricing Transparency & User Understanding</h3>
To keep course pricing reasonable, affordable, and accessible for learners, MK Trader has adopted
this content delivery method.
Users acknowledge and understand that occasional third-party advertisements, if displayed by YouTube,
may require reasonable compromise and do not affect the quality or ownership of the purchased course content.

<h3>19. Data Sharing & Privacy Protection</h3>
MK Trader does not share users’ personal data with YouTube, except for the minimal technical information
required to enable video playback.
Any data processed by YouTube is governed by YouTube’s own Privacy Policy.
Users are encouraged to review YouTube’s privacy practices independently.

<h3>20. Limitation of Responsibility</h3>
MK Trader shall not be held responsible for any changes made by YouTube to its platform,
advertising behavior, content policies, or service availability.
Continued use of the MK Trader app constitutes acceptance of this content delivery approach.
